<p>This document (the “Terms”) together with the U.S. Privacy Policy (collectively the “Agreement”) sets out the terms and conditions governing visits, access and use of the music service TIDAL by the end user (“you”). The term “you” includes additional registered users whenever permitted under the applicable subscription, visitors, and others who access or use any of the Services.

    The “Services” means the music service branded TIDAL, mobile and device applications and all services provided by TIDAL or TIDAL’s vendors, or other third parties with whom TIDAL (as defined herein) contracts to provide the Services that are inherently related to the music service TIDAL or that are compatible for similarly situated digital music services. These may include, but are not limited to websites and applications for desktops, tablets and mobile handsets, set-top boxes and stereo equipment. The Services also include your ability to edit certain Service Content (as that term is defined in Section 8, below) that is specifically cleared for such use (the “Editable Content”) and User Content (as that term is defined in Section 9, below), and save such edited Editable Content and User Content to your own playlist without the ability to share or otherwise reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, or publicly display such edited Editable Content and User Content (the “Edit Functionality”). Each instance of edited Editable Content or edited User Content shall be deemed a “Remix” hereunder.

    The Services are provided by Aspiro AB and Project Panther US LLC and their affiliated entities, and each of their present, former and future parents, predecessors, successors, assignees, subsidiaries, owners, officers and directors (whether acting in such capacity or individually), agents and attorneys (collectively, “TIDAL,” “we” “us” and/or “our”). You may contact us at: TIDAL – Customer Support, 540 W 26th Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10001, or by email at support@tidal.com.

    The current Agreement will appear on our website with the effective date that the Terms and/or Privacy Policy were updated. TIDAL may, in its discretion, make changes to the Agreement. When we make material changes to the Agreement, we will provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, for example, by sending you an email. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Services under the new version of the Agreement, you may terminate the Agreement by contacting us at support@tidal.com.</p>
